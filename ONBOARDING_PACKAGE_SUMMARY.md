## üéØ Key Information for New Agents

### **Critical Context**
1. **Major Achievement**: TypeScript refactoring Phases 1-4 are complete
2. **Critical Bug Fixed**: Paint index initialization issue resolved
3. **Current Focus**: Type consistency across page components
4. **Quality Standard**: High-quality, well-documented, type-safe code

### **Immediate Priorities**
1. **`pages/agents/index.vue`** - Uses legacy `SteamUser`, `APIAgent`
2. **`pages/weapons/[type].vue`** - Uses legacy `WeaponCustomization`
3. **`pages/knifes/index.vue`** - Uses legacy `KnifeCustomization`
4. **`pages/gloves/index.vue`** - Needs audit and potential migration

### **Essential Knowledge**
- **Import Pattern**: Always use `import type { ... } from '~/types'`
- **Database Fields**: Use lowercase field names (`paintindex`, not `paintIndex`)
- **Database Interfaces**: Use specific interfaces (`DBKnife`, not `IMappedDBWeapon`)
- **Error Handling**: Follow established patterns with proper user feedback

## üîß Quick Start Guide

### **For New Agents**
1. **Read First**: `NEW_AGENT_ONBOARDING.md`
2. **Understand Context**: `PROJECT_STATE_README.md`
3. **Plan Work**: `TYPE_CONSISTENCY_AUDIT_PLAN.md`
4. **Execute**: `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDELINES.md`

### **Reference Materials**
- `types/README.md` - Complete type system documentation
- `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Developer cheat sheet
- `TYPESCRIPT_REFACTORING_GUIDE.md` - Migration examples
- Successfully migrated components as templates

## üö® Critical Warnings

### **DO NOT**
- ‚ùå Use `IMappedDBWeapon` for knives/gloves (causes paint index bug)
- ‚ùå Import from `~/types/business/items` directly
- ‚ùå Use uppercase database field names
- ‚ùå Break backward compatibility without approval
- ‚ùå Skip testing after type changes

### **ALWAYS**
- ‚úÖ Import from `~/types` main module
- ‚úÖ Use correct database interfaces (`DBKnife`, `DBGlove`)
- ‚úÖ Use lowercase database field names (`paintindex`, `paintseed`)
- ‚úÖ Test paint index loading for existing items
- ‚úÖ Follow established error handling patterns

## üìä Project Status Summary

### **‚úÖ Completed (Production Ready)**
- Core type system architecture (`~/types` module)
- Modal components (WeaponSkinModal, KnifeSkinModal, GloveSkinModal)
- Display components (InspectItemDisplay)
- Tab components (WeaponTabs, KnifeTabs, GloveTabs)
- Composables (useInspectItem)
- Critical paint index bug fix
- Database field mapping validation
- Comprehensive documentation

### **üöß In Progress (Your Focus)**
- Page component type consistency
- Server-side type migration
- Complete legacy type removal

### **üìã Future Enhancements**
- Runtime validation using type definitions
- API client generation from response types
- Type-safe database schema evolution
- Component generation from types

## üéØ Success Metrics

### **Completion Criteria**
- [ ] Zero legacy type imports in page components
- [ ] All `*Customization` types replaced with `*Configuration`
- [ ] Consistent import patterns across all files
- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- [ ] All functional tests pass
- [ ] No regression in user functionality

### **Quality Standards**
- **Type Safety**: 100% (no `any` types in migrated code)
- **Import Consistency**: 100% (all imports from `~/types`)
- **Documentation**: 100% (all new patterns documented)
- **Backward Compatibility**: 100% (maintained during transition)

## ü§ù Support Resources

### **When You Need Help**
1. **Check Documentation**: Start with the onboarding materials
2. **Review Examples**: Look at successfully migrated components
3. **Validate Approach**: Use the implementation guidelines
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Follow the testing procedures

### **Key Reference Components**
- **`components/WeaponSkinModal.vue`** - Complete migration example
- **`components/KnifeSkinModal.vue`** - Database field mapping example
- **`components/GloveSkinModal.vue`** - Simplified configuration example

## üöÄ Getting Started

### **Immediate Next Steps**
1. **Read the onboarding materials** in order
2. **Examine the current codebase** to understand the state
3. **Start with `pages/agents/index.vue`** as your first migration
4. **Follow the implementation guidelines** step by step
5. **Test thoroughly** after each change

### **Expected Timeline**
- **Week 1**: Complete understanding and first page migration
- **Week 2**: Migrate remaining high-priority pages
- **Week 3**: Address medium-priority files
- **Week 4**: Final validation and cleanup
