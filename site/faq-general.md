Common questions about CS2Inspect and getting started.

## What is CS2Inspect?

CS2Inspect is a web application that allows Counter-Strike 2 players to customize and manage their in-game item loadouts. You can customize weapon skins, knives, gloves, agents, music kits, and pins with full control over float values, StatTrakâ„¢, stickers, and more.

## Is CS2Inspect free to use?

Yes, the application is open source and free to use. You need a Steam account to log in and save your configurations.

## Do I need CS2 to use this application?

You don't need CS2 installed to use the application. However, to import items from inspect URLs, the backend needs access to Steam's Game Coordinator, which requires a Steam account configured in the server.

## Will this modify my actual CS2 inventory?

No, CS2Inspect does not and cannot modify your actual Steam inventory. It only stores your loadout configurations in the database for you to view and manage. To use these configurations in-game, you would need a compatible CS2 server plugin.
