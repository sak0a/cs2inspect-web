- Glove skins (T and CT side)

## Weapon Customization

### What can I customize on weapons?

For most weapons:
- **Skin**: Choose from thousands of available skins
- **Float Value**: Wear from 0.00 (Factory New) to 1.00 (Battle-Scarred)
- **Pattern Seed**: Affects pattern placement (0-1000)
- **StatTrak™**: Enable kill counter
- **Name Tag**: Custom weapon name
- **Stickers**: Up to 5 stickers per weapon
- **Keychains**: Attach keychains (CS2 feature)

### What is float value?

Float value determines the wear condition of a skin, ranging from 0.00 (Factory New - cleanest) to 1.00 (Battle-Scarred - most worn). Lower float values generally look better.

### What is pattern seed?

Pattern seed affects how the skin pattern is placed on the weapon. This is especially important for certain skins like Case Hardened, Fade, and Marble Fade where different patterns can have significantly different appearances.

### What are Doppler phases?

Doppler skins have different color variations (phases) that are determined by the pattern seed. Some phases (like Ruby, Sapphire, and Black Pearl) are rarer and more valuable than others.

### How do I add stickers to weapons?

1. Select a weapon
2. Click on a sticker slot
3. Search for your desired sticker
4. Click to apply it
5. Save your changes

You can add up to 5 stickers per weapon.

### Can I position stickers precisely?

Yes! Use the Visual Customizer for advanced sticker positioning with drag-and-drop, rotation, and scaling controls.

### What is StatTrak™?

StatTrak™ is a feature that adds a kill counter to your weapon. In CS2Inspect, you can enable StatTrak™ and set a custom kill count value.

### Can I add name tags to weapons?

Yes, you can add custom name tags to most weapons. Enter your desired name in the name tag field when customizing the weapon.

## Inspect Links

### What is an inspect link?

An inspect link is a special URL from CS2 that contains encoded item data. You can get inspect links from:
- Steam Community Market
- CS2 in-game (right-click item → Copy Inspect Link)
- Player inventories
- Trading websites

### What are masked and unmasked URLs?

There are two types of inspect links:
- **Masked URLs**: Contain all item data encoded directly in the link (common on Steam Market)
- **Unmasked URLs**: Reference an item in someone's inventory (used for player inventory items)

Both types can be imported into CS2Inspect.

### How do I import an item from an inspect link?

1. Copy inspect link from CS2 or Steam Market
2. Click "Import from Inspect Link"
3. Paste URL
4. Click "Import"
5. The item configuration will be loaded into your loadout

### Why doesn't my inspect link work?

Common issues:
- Link is incomplete or corrupted
- Item is no longer in the inventory (for unmasked links)
- Backend server cannot connect to Steam
- Invalid item data in the link

Try a different link or check with your administrator.
