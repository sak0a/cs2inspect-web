# Documentation Diagrams

This directory contains diagrams used in the CS2Inspect documentation.

## About

Diagrams are primarily created using Mermaid syntax and embedded directly in markdown files. This directory can be used for static diagram exports (PNG, SVG) if needed.

## Current Diagrams

All diagrams are embedded in documentation files using Mermaid:
- Architecture diagrams in [architecture.md](../architecture.md)
- Sequence diagrams in [how-it-works.md](../how-it-works.md)
- Flow diagrams throughout documentation

## Adding Diagrams

To add static diagrams, place them here and reference from documentation:

```markdown
![Diagram name](diagrams/diagram-name.svg)
```

For more information about creating and managing diagrams, see the documentation guidelines.
